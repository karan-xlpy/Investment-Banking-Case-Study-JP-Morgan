## File Formats and Accessibility

- The task instructions were initially provided in a Word document, but I have uploaded it as a PDF file for better view and understanding.
- I have uploaded the PDF file of the PowerPoint presentation because the `.pptx` file does not display clearly on GitHub. The PDF provides a better view and understanding.
- The Excel file has been converted to CSV format for easier access, but due to the formatting provided by the organizer team, it may still be unclear. Therefore, I have uploaded both the CSV file and an additional PDF version for better understanding.

## Task 1: Speak to the Hong Kong team and then provide your Managing Director with M&A target ideas.

Acquisitions Analysis and Feasibility Assessment

In this task, I evaluated potential acquisition targets for our client by analyzing their strategic and financial fit. I considered the shareholder structures of the targets to assess the simplicity and feasibility of each acquisition option, ensuring that recommendations were both viable and aligned with the client's strategic objectives.

## Task 2: Perform a target company deep dive and provide a summary of this auction process.

First slide: Company overview including basic information on the company, its ownership structure, key financials (including EBITDA margin and net profit margin) and an indicative valuation. 

Second slide: Overview of the auction process and next steps (based on the process letter that the HK team shared). There is a lot of information in the process letter but at this stage let's just tried to present the high level, key information to Carlos.

## Task 3: Prepare a discounted cash flow valuation based on the forecasts received.

In this task, I built a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on updated financial projections and assumptions provided by the company. I used the 'advanced' template to calculate the DCF valuation, then summarized the findings and key assumptions in a PowerPoint presentation.

## Task 4: Consider valuation implications following unforeseen events. (DCF Model Adjustments)

In this task, I updated the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model by revising the revenue for FY21 to $1,100 million and setting the gross margin to 50.0% in the 'Company fin forecasts' tab. I then recalculated the gross profit based on the new gross margin and reviewed the impact of these changes on the 'DCF output' tab to assess the updated valuation.
